🥗 The Smartest AI Nutrition Assistant
🚀 Project Overview
In an era of increasing health awareness, people are seeking personalized nutrition advice tailored to their unique lifestyles, medical conditions, and preferences. Unfortunately, most available tools offer generic plans that don’t adapt in real-time or account for cultural and dietary nuances.

This project aims to solve that problem by developing a cutting-edge AI-powered virtual nutrition assistant using IBM Cloud and generative AI technologies. The assistant leverages advanced natural language processing (NLP), multimodal inputs, and personalized data to deliver dynamic, intelligent nutrition guidance—accessible to anyone, anywhere.

🎯 The Challenge
Most diet apps provide one-size-fits-all meal plans.

Lack of consideration for personal health conditions, cultural food preferences, and allergies.

Limited scalability for human nutritionists and dieticians.

No dynamic adaptation based on continuous user feedback.
